Welcome to my Data Science portfolio on GitHub!

This repository contains a selection of Data Science projects that I have carried out in recent months. Here you will find a sample of my skills in the use of data analysis tools and machine learning techniques to solve business and social problems.

In each project, you will find a detailed description of the data used, the methodology used, and the results obtained. I also include a set of interactive visualizations and charts so you can explore the data and better understand the findings.

I invite you to explore my portfolio and learn more about my skills and experience in Data Science. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me. Thanks for visiting my portfolio on GitHub!
